It's takes two series which starts in the hunt for Sam Tyler and finishes with the classic battle of good versus evil and redemption. Lofty stuff but done very well with some great performances helped by superb scripts.";

	predicate:content_is "Time seems to have eclipsed exactly how popular this BAFTA-nominated British sitcom once was in its heyday. In its time it regularly topped the UK TV ratings, even elbowing Coronation Street and EastEnders from the top spot on occasions. This was definitely one of ITV's better sitcoms of the day and was often hailed as 'ITV's answer to Fawlty Towers'. This is something of an overstatement as it's not a patch on Fawlty Towers, but it certainly has SOMETHING going for it. Strictly lightweight fare, this is, perhaps, perfect viewing for a rainy Sunday afternoon (if you like this sort of thing that is).Written by Eric Chappell and Jean Warr, the former being the mastermind behind another classic ITV sitcom, Rising Damp, Duty Free, like Rising Damp before it, began life as a stage play prior to being developed into a television series. With the television series going into production in late 1983, its first series aired in early 1984 and was an immediate hit, leading to three series', the final being aired in 1986 (the same year it was nominated for a BAFTA but lost out to Just Good Friends ). The premise of Duty Free was centered around two warring couples, both from completely different backgrounds. David (Keith Barron) is in Spain with his wife Amy (Gwen Taylor) after having been made redundant following years of service as a draughtsman. This is meant to be like a second honeymoon for the couple but all of these plans go out the window when they meet another English couple at the San Remo hotel in which they're staying: the stuffy Robert (Neil Stacy) and the elegant though effected and snobbish Linda (Joanna Van Gyseghem). An instant attraction between the ever-pretentious David and Linda becomes all too apparent, while Robert remains completely oblivious and Amy looks on in horror, desperate to save her marriage. David and Linda often try to consummate their feelings for one another, but all often their plans are thwarted by Amy who outsmarts them every time. It's all a little bit 'Carry On' style as its often pure farce with the characters hiding under beds and in wardrobes, several misunderstandings leading to utter disaster and bed-hopping galore. Corny, yes, but taking into consideration that it's a product of its time, it still manages to sparkle, not least due to some engaging performances and good writing. It doesn't pretend to be anything else than what it says on the tin, so you can either take it or leave it, and personally I have a soft spot for Duty Free as I clearly recall this being the first ever sitcom I truly loved - and this was when I was four-years old! And I remember it making me laugh out loud when I was that four-year old boy some thirty odd years ago! The question is does it make me laugh now? Well, in parts yes it does. I can't say it brims with big belly laughs but it makes for pleasantly entertaining viewing and still  makes me smile and chuckle.Of course as many of you will know who remember that it's not really filmed in Spain (bar the 1986 Christmas special) but is in fact all filmed in a tiny studio in Yorkshire TV studios. This is patently obvious when looking at some of the cardboard-like sets and the several artificial palm trees added for a touch of authenticity, but in a funny sort of way it's all part of its charm. The show was clearly on a budget but even in spite of the silliness of the plots and the often corny dialogue, the cast all give off an air of knowing its restrictions yet all committed to making it all work. And that they do.Now for me (and many others I'm sure) the true star of Duty Free is undoubtedly Gwen Taylor. She manages to unwittingly steal every scene she's in, delivering her sharp, witty put-downs with aplomb and such impeccable comic timing. Her down-to-earthiness balances her co-star Keith Barron and the more conservative and restrained performances of Neil Stacy and Joanna Van Gyseghem. Another cast member in a smaller role who deserves a mention is Carlos Douglas as the ever-so-camp waiter, Carlos. He quickly becomes aware of David and Linda's romance and is often unwittingly used as a foil to fend off an ever-suspicious Amy. His whole demeanour is amusing and is a much-welcome addition to the cast.Like several British sitcoms, much of the comedy stems from class-related tensions between the two couples: The Pierces (David and Amy) are working-class socialists from Northampton, whereas the Cochrans are a more affluent, middle-class conservative couple from Henley-On-Thames in Oxfordshire. What enrages Amy more than anything is the change she sees in her husband David upon meeting Robert and Linda, David seemingly forcing himself to change his outlook and thoughts on politics just to impress Linda whom he is besotted with.Fun and games throughout and undemanding viewing to say the least, Duty Free still deserves its place in the TV Hall of Fame, even if not as revered as the likes of Rising Damp. Sometimes the jokes can be cringeworthy, other times actually being quite witty. Nowadays you can find Duty Free re-runs on ITV3, usually in an afternoon or late-night slot, though a few years ago the show was revived for a stage play which saw most of the original cast reunited for a nationwide tour. Like the original TV series of the 80s, it drew a mixed critical response and though there have been talks of a new TV series, this seems unlikely, although this may be a wise decision; it's probably better off being remembered rather than revived.EPISODE GUIDEDISC ONE: SERIES ONE (1984)Viva EspanaDavid and Amy arrive at the San Remo Hotel in the Costa Del Sol and meet another couple, Robert and Linda. David soon falls under the spell of the glamorous Linda, much to Amy's annoyance. While Robert is blissfully unaware of his wife's amorous intentions with David, Amy sets out to win back her man. El MachoDavid, Amy, Linda and Robert head off on a trip to see a bullfight. Amy is literally dragged along, totally opposed to bull fighting and she eventually becomes embroiled in an argument with the infamous bullfighter, El Macho. Praying MantisDavid is becoming more and more besotted with Linda. They meet secretly but disaster strikes when David is attacked by a savage dog leaving him bed bound.Spanish LaceThe two warring couples take a trip to the mountains together but money runs out fast thanks to David buying one present too many for Linda. Bedroom FarceAmy grows suspicious following David and Linda's midnight swim and their attempts to consummate their romance are constantly foiled thanks to bad planning.Forty LoveThis is a true CLASSIC episode of Duty Free. The building romance between David and Linda comes to a head when Amy catches them passionately kissing in their hotel room. What follows is a great verbal tennis match as emotions run high and all ends in a cake fight!Hasta La VistaSeries one draws to a close and following the previous episode where Amy finally caught David and Linda kissing, the adulterous couple decide to leave Spain together. But Amy's not giving up without a fight and while Robert hits the bottle, unable to cope with the shock of his wife leaving him, Amy hatches a cunning plan to thwart her husband's plan.DISC TWO: SERIES TWO (1984)MananaThe eagerly-awaited second series returned to television screens just six months later and is set during the couples second week of their holiday. David has been disowned by not only Linda, but also his wife Amy and an understandably bitter Robert. Wanted by the police thanks to being set up by Amy, he tries to smuggle himself past the police officers with disasterous consequences. Meanwhile, Linda is reunited with Robert and David begrudgingly goes back to his wife Amy. CasinoDavid feels he's on a luck streak after winning a huge amount at the Casino. However, in a flash he ends up losing most of his winnings and it's left up to Amy to save the day. CouplesA young couple arrive at the San Remo Hotel on their honeymoon and quickly catch the attentions of David, Amy, Linda and Robert. With romance in the air, misunderstandings flow when the young couple manage to mix and match the wrong couples. El AstroExcitement is in the air at the San Remo Hotel when actor Frazer Hines from Emmerdale Farm arrives. Linda is smitten and star-struck but it's Amy who catches the eye of Frazer Hines and he tries in vain to woo her. PepeA mysterious chain of events starts when David, Amy, Linda and Robert take a day trip from Spain to Tangier. After reluctantly agreeing to carry a parcel back into Spain, Amy suddenly fears the package could contain drugs. However, getting rid of the evidence proves more difficult than anticipated...SnapDavid is horrified when his old nemesis Kevin arrives at the hotel. Kevin was the man responsible for David's redundancy and their history stretches long before that as he had been dogged by Kevin all his life - at school, in the army and in the office! Will David finally serve Kevin his long overdue comeuppance?AdiosAll good things must come to an end as they say, and this episode is set during the last day of both couples holidays. In addition to packing bottles of booze, a last look round and a trip to Pedro's, the local bar, David and Linda are desperate to spend one last romantic day together....but their lingering farewells are continually interrupted.....DISC THREE: SERIES THREE AND CHRISTMAS SPECIAL (1986)Winter BreakThe action is now set eighteen months later: David is unemployed and depressed and Amy has become the main breadwinner. Absence certainly makes the heart fonder in David and Linda's case and despite a long time apart it seems they can't forget each other. David tells Amy that he is going on holiday to Spain to have a break from it all. In reality, David is heading off for a secret holiday with Linda. Typically, both Amy and Robert arrive in hot pursuit of their partners. Deja VuAmy is still suspicious of her husband and her suspicions are confirmed when she sees Linda and realises that's who he was really intending to spend his holiday with. Later when Robert spots David, he ends up trying to throttle him. Close UpAnother favourite episode of mine! The team behind the holidaymakers series _Wish You Were Here, along with Judith Chalmers, have arrived and David, Amy, Linda and Robert are determined to be seen on TV. The Go-BetweenA misfit named Neville befriends David and Linda and he becomes inextricably involved with their not-so-secret romance. Although he proves more than keen to help them out, he manages to get everything wrong and has an unfortunate encounter with a chimpanzee. Costa del CrimeDavid discovers he's picked up the wrong tartan bag at the airport which leads to an unwelcome visit from its dangerous owners. Cause CelebreThe new manager of the San Remo Hotel makes some unexpected - and unwanted - staff changes which upsets the holidaymakers and the waiter Carlos. Amy encourages Carlos to make a stand which turns out to be a bad move on his part as he's soon fired. Party NightIt's fancy dress night during the last night of the couples holiday and both decide to enter the talent contest. Amy surprises her husband with her striking impersonation of Greta Garbo which seemingly brings him back down to earth and realises Amy is really the one for him. A Duty Free ChristmasI'd go so far to say this is the best episode of the entire series: There's no studio laughter here as we're off and away from the constraints from the previous studio-bound episodes and head off to the REAL Spain; and it's all the far better for it as it gives the whole premise an air of realism. Despite Amy managing to win her husband David back round, it seems David is set on one final fling with Linda....but of course nothing goes according to plan...Special Features & PresentationThere are no special features sadly but the presentation of the series is excellent in both sound and visual quality. While some of the jokes are creaky, the look of this DVD is fresh, making it an enjoyable watch all round. Not one for everyone, but fans of Duty Free will undoubtedly relish a box set which contains the entire series at a very affordable price. While not being the best sitcom of all time, Duty Free_is most definitely a classic and the series flows very well for its age, still holding a lot of energy. Fans of classic British comedy will love this - I certainly do!Ian Phillips";

It felt boring for me and I stopped watching, but after few years, I decided to give it a chance and continue. I'm so happy because of my decision, because after finishing this TV show, I can definitely tell that it was a masterpiece! 5th season is a bomb and 14th season was shocking! It left me with sad, euphoric shock feeling. It was mind blowing! I'm not gonna spoil you what happened, but if you started first season and you don't like it, for goodness sake, give it a chance and continue watching. I promise you won't regret.Characters are very well developed. Acting is superb! Plot is very interesting. Whole TV show is tense, especially the last season. The only downside I can think about is camera. Sometimes it's shaking on some certain scenes. I don't know why they didn't pay attention to this, but this is nothing, just a very minor minus. Everything else is great about this TV show.";

Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. Fantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises!";

The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. And all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.";

	predicate:content_is "This series starts off like some of the best out there. Although it makes some minor adjustments, it follows the story from the books quite faithfully for the first 4 seasons. And adds a twinkle of big budget movies, and great cinematography. Truly awesome. Up until this point, I was in love with the series, a 10/10. I quickly read all the books, and re-watched all seasons before a new one would come out.However, from season 5 and onwards, it starts going downhill. They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable. From here all major characters receive plot-armor, which was one of the things it didn't have before, and that made it interesting to watch. Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.The last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch. What a pitiful way to go out. Hopefully the books finish the story in a more interesting and believable way.";

I'm big fan of Vikings TV series and when I asked opinion about GOT to my friend, he said Vikings is nothing compared to GOT. All my coworkers are GOT addicts, so finally I gave it a try. I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending.";

I smile when I remember seeing a review for another great show that had a higher rating than Game of Thrones, and the reviewer said that the other show was a good show but he gave it just one star because he couldn’t believe it was ranked higher than GOT. I thought, I guess I need to watch this Thrones show that has such rabid devotees.I expected a sort of Lord of the Rings on steroids, but I don’t know what drug it is on. The settings and characters are realistic, and the Machiavellian plot lines seems to make sense to me for a while.  As the series went on, however, my interest began to flag a bit. Some of the characters that seemed complex at the outset, devolved into predictable two-dimensional stereotypes. And my stars, the number of rapes going on. I recognize that in such society rape was probably commonplace, but it was likely so in Ancient Rome also, and yet the great series Rome found other ways to titillate than the one-trick pony of forced entry.So I confess I didn’t make it to the end of the show, but from what I hear, even big fans of the show were let down by how it all wound down.";
